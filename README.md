# Hello, I'm Javi Trek! (he/him) üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà
## I'm a Computer Science Student & Volunteer at [Forged Alliance Forever](https://github.com/FAForever)
- I'm currently learning HTML(PUG), CSS (SASS), and JS (Vanilla js, Node.js).
- I'm working on the re-design of the [new FAF Website](https://www.test.faforever.com/) ([Code here](https://github.com/FAForever/website/tree/New-Frontend))
- I'm looking to contribute and start websites/projects for non-profits and other helpful communities.

## About Me
- Quick learner and not afraid to learn new foreign concepts. 
- Currently hold a Bachelor of Science in Psychology (now transitioning to a B.A in Computer Science or Software Engineer).
- Thoughtful teamworker, I try always getting a wide fan of opinions and ideas from my fellow contributors and members of the community before implementing new ideas.
