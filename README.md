# Heya! üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà
Nice to meet you! I'm Javi (she, he or them pronouns), I'm a non-binary student at Miami Dade College (MDC, specifically the North Campus!). 
I got a background/degree in Psychology but I've switched careers to programming! I'm mainly doing web development but I've ventured into DevOps and IT here and there.

# My work and experience as a self-taught developer
- Developed the [website](https://faforever.com/) of open-source Danish organization [FAForever](https://github.com/FAForever), which
oversees the development of FAF, a strategy video-game with over a 1000 users playing daily.
- Created and [hosted (website)](https://www.wars-world.com/) a full stack MERN application under 9 weeks [(repository)](https://github.com/FemboyDeveloper/AW-Competitive), creating a multiplayer chess like stratey game with seamless real-time gameplay.
- Currently working on making Wars-World more than just a demo, right now it's an open-source project open to anyone!
- I have won 2 hackathons! First [ShellHacks](https://devpost.com/software/sundered-starlight) with over 1200 participants and [KnightHacks](https://devpost.com/software/lawlinker) with over 700!

# About me
## How did I get into programming
During COVID I started helping an open-source project [FAForever](https://github.com/FAForever), I mostly did graphic media and promotional content for them. 
One day, I wanted to change the website images and they told me to learn HTML and CSS. I learned those and I started getting a bit mentored by the dev team. 
Before I knew it, I was working to re-create the entire website! It took me about a year but we launched the new website and the rest is history.

## Me and the community
Besides being a GitHub campus expert, I'm the workshop manager for INIT MDC! INIT is a student organization that builds up students with experiences, tools and knowledge to succeed in their tech careers, specifically when it comes to getting internships!
So, I do workshops on my campus every week! Usually focused on web-development and how to get better at algorithms/data structures. My goal is to help students being able to build projects or interact with open source projects and get internships!

I'm also trying really hard as a queer individual to make space for other queer members. Making sure all the workshops and community space are safe and sound for everyone! No matter who you are or your level of experience, you are welcome here!
## How can I help you?
I'm super duper happy to guide you on how to jumpstart your career, learning to work with open source projects and overall have fun while programming!
You can also come to my workshops which are free for everyone! I'm trying to also put them on zoom and youtube, stay tuned!

If you want to reach out to me, the best way is through Discord! My username is femboy.io or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/javier-bracho/)
